# NumPy Essentials and Operations

## Overview

This project is a detailed demonstration of NumPy â€” Python's core library for numerical computing. It covers a wide variety of NumPy functionalities, making it a valuable reference for beginners and intermediate users.

## Features

The script includes:

1. **Array Creation**  
   - 1D, 2D arrays, zeros, ones, ranges, and linspace.

2. **Array Attributes**  
   - Shape, dimensions, and data types.

3. **Basic Operations**  
   - Element-wise operations, universal functions like `sqrt`.

4. **Indexing and Slicing**  
   - Standard, fancy, and negative indexing.

5. **Boolean Masking**  
   - Filtering data based on conditions.

6. **Reshaping Arrays**  
   - `reshape()`, `stack`, `split` methods.

7. **Broadcasting**  
   - Operations on arrays with different shapes.

8. **Linear Algebra**  
   - Matrix multiplication, inverse, determinant, eigenvalues, SVD.

9. **Random Number Generation**  
   - Uniform, normal, integers, and reproducibility with seed.

10. **Custom Universal Functions**  
    - Using `np.vectorize()`.

11. **Performance Techniques**  
    - Vectorization vs. looping, memory efficiency, and advanced indexing.

12. **Memory and Storage**  
    - Views vs. copies, strides, memory footprint.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`

Install NumPy using:
```bash
pip install numpy
